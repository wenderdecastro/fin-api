# fin-api
API built with Python to learn and review some concepts about Data Modeling, REST APIs, Python and Web development. This API perform CRUD operations on some financial control data.

In this project, I want to implement my personal financial sheet in the form of an API. I also plan to experiment with some machine learning integrations and Docker, so Iâ€™ll implement a few ML models for study and future deployment. :p
